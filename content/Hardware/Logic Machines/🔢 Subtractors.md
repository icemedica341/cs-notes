Subtractor circuits are foundational in any complex logic circuit

## ⚙️ Half Subtractor

```
Borrow
	    A
-       B
-------------
        Diff
```


> [!info] Logic Equations
> $\text{Diff} = A \oplus B$  
> $\text{Borrow} = \overline{A} \cdot B$

> [!tip] Notes
>
> - No borrow-in input
> - Cannot be chained directly for multi-bit subtraction
> - Gate count: **1 XOR**, **1 AND**, **1 NOT**

| A | B | Diff (A⊕B) | Borrow ($\overline{A} \cdot B$) |
|---|---|-------------|-------------------------------|
| 0 | 0 |     0       |             0                 |
| 0 | 1 |     1       |             1                 |
| 1 | 0 |     1       |             0                 |
| 1 | 1 |     0       |             0                 |

	         A
-            B
------------------------
		     Diff
```
> [!info] Logic Equations
> $\text{Diff} = A \oplus B \oplus B_{in}$  
> $B_{out} = B \cdot B_{in} + \overline{A} \cdot (B \oplus B_{in})$

> [!tip] Notes
>
> - Can be chained for multi-bit subtraction
> - Minimal logic avoids redundancy using XOR
> - Exhaustive logic is more intuitive but less gate-efficient
> - Gate count (minimal): **2 XOR**, **2 AND**, **1 OR**, **1 NOT**

| A | B | Bin | Diff | Bout |
|---|---|-----|------|------|
| 0 | 0 |  0  |  0   |  0   |
| 0 | 0 |  1  |  1   |  1   |
| 0 | 1 |  0  |  1   |  1   |
| 0 | 1 |  1  |  0   |  1   |
| 1 | 0 |  0  |  1   |  0   |
| 1 | 0 |  1  |  0   |  0   |
| 1 | 1 |  0  |  0   |  0   |
