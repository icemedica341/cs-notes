Linear algebra is the mathematics of **vectors**, **matrices**, and **linear transformations**. It governs systems where **scaling** and **adding** behave predictably—preserving structure, direction, and proportionality.

It’s not just “math on arrays”—it’s the **logic of linear relationships**, used in geometry, physics, computer graphics, machine learning, and more.

### 🔹 Core Objects

| Object | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Scalars | Single numbers (from a field like $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$) |
| Vectors | Ordered lists of scalars (1D arrays) |
| Matrices | Rectangular arrays of scalars (2D arrays) |
| Linear maps | Functions that preserve addition and scalar multiplication |

### 🔹 Approved Operations in Linear Algebra

| Operation | Description | Preserves Linearity? |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Vector addition | $x + y$ | ✅ |
| Scalar multiplication | $a \cdot x$ | ✅ |
| Matrix addition | $A + B$ | ✅ |
| Matrix multiplication | $AB$ | ✅ |
| Dot product | $x \cdot y$ | ✅ |
| Transpose | $A^T$ | ✅ |
| Inverse (when defined) | $A^{-1}$ | ✅ |
| Identity matrix | $I_n$ | ✅ |
| Zero matrix | $0_{n \times m}$ | ✅ |

These operations are **structure-preserving** and support solving systems, composing transformations, and modeling geometry.

### 🔹 Why Some Operations Are Not Approved

Linear algebra excludes operations that **break linearity**, **lack transformation logic**, or **don’t generalize**.

| Operation | Description | Reason for Exclusion |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Hadamard product | Element-wise multiplication | ❌ Breaks linearity |
| Cross product | Only defined in $\mathbb{R}^3$ | ❌ Not generalizable |
| ReLU / activation | Nonlinear functions | ❌ Breaks linearity |
| Vector multiplication | Ambiguous (no canonical definition) | ❌ Violates structure |
| Entry-wise division | Undefined in matrix algebra | ❌ No transformation meaning |

### 🔹 Semantic Audit: What Linear Algebra Requires

| Requirement | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| Linearity | Ensures predictable behavior under scaling and addition |
| Dimensional consistency | Guarantees valid compositions |
| Associativity | Enables chaining of transformations |
| Closure | Keeps results inside the same space |
| Generalizability | Works across $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\mathbb{C}^n$, etc. |

### 🔹 Philosophical Framing

Linear algebra is the **language of linear structure**:

- It models how systems respond to **scaling** and **combination**
- It encodes **geometry**, **symmetry**, and **composition**
- It excludes operations that don’t respect these principles

Would you like to scaffold a companion module on **nonlinear operations** and how they extend or break the linear framework—especially in neural nets, optimization, or physics? It’s a great contrast for vault clarity.
