title: "🔁 `always` and `end`"
date: 2025-11-08

---

Understanding the role of `always` and `end` in Verilog is essential for modeling reactive logic and building audit-ready hardware systems. This note scaffolds their purpose, behavior, and relationship to control flow.

---

## 🔁 `always` Block

> **Definition**: A procedural block that executes when triggered by a sensitivity list.

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    y = a & b;
end
```

> [!info] Behavior
> - Runs whenever any signal in the sensitivity list changes.
> - Can describe **combinational** or **sequential** logic depending on the trigger.
> - Acts like a **reactive container**, not a conditional.

### ✅ Characteristics
- **Event-driven**: triggered by changes or clock edges.
- **Encapsulates logic**: can include `if`, `case`, loops, assignments.
- **Used for**: FSMs, counters, decoders, ALUs.

### 📌 Notes
- `always @(*)` → combinational logic
- `always @(posedge clk)` → sequential logic
- Not a decision—it’s a **scope** for reactive behavior

---

## 🔚 `end` Keyword

> **Definition**: Closes a `begin` block or control structure.

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    if (sel)
        y = a;
    else
        y = b;
end
```

> [!info] Behavior
> - Paired with `begin` to define multi-statement blocks.
> - Also used to close `if`, `case`, `for`, and other control structures.

### ✅ Characteristics
- **Structural**: defines block boundaries.
- **Required** when using `begin` for multiple statements.
- **Optional** for single-line control flow.

## 🧪 Comparison Table

| Keyword   | Role                          | Required When…                      |
|-----------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `always`  | Starts reactive logic block   | You want event-driven behavior      |
| `begin`   | Opens multi-statement block   | You have more than one statement    |
| `end`     | Closes the block              | Always paired with `begin`          |

## 🧭 Is `always` Like `if-else`?

> [!warning] Misconception
> `always` is **not** a conditional—it’s a **reactive scope**.

### ✅ Clarification
- You write `if-else` **inside** an `always` block.
- The `always` block itself is **not a decision**, it’s a **triggered container**.

### 🧪 Example

```verilog
always @(*) begin
    if (sel)
        y = a;
    else
        y = b;
end
```

- This models a **multiplexer**.
- The block runs whenever `sel`, `a`, or `b` changes.
- The `if-else` is the decision logic; `always` is the reactive wrapper.

## 🧰 Vault Notes

> [!tip] Rule of Thumb
> Use `always` to define **when** logic should run.  
> Use `if`, `case`, etc. inside to define **what** logic should run.

> [!example] Combinational Decoder
> ```verilog
> always @(*) begin
>     case (in)
>         2'b00: out = 4'b0001;
>         2'b01: out = 4'b0010;
>         2'b10: out = 4'b0100;
>         2'b11: out = 4'b1000;
>     endcase
> end
> ```

> [!example] Sequential Counter
> ```verilog
> always @(posedge clk) begin
>     if (rst)
>         count <= 0;
>     else
>         count <= count + 1;
> end
> ```

> [!warning] Common Mistake
> Don’t confuse `always` with `if`.  
> `always` defines **when** logic runs—not **what** decision is made.
